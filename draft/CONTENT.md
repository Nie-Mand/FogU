- Get Familiar with Fog Computing Technologies
- Fog Computing vs Cloud Computing
- Simulation of Fog Computing components

Stuffs

## Types 
- Device-Level fog computing (runs in devices, collects data for analysis)
- Edge-level fog computing (runs on servers on the edge, process data before being sent)
- Gateway-level fog computing (runs in devices that act as gateways between the edge and the cloud, manage and filter traffic) 
- Cloud-level fog computing (process data before being sent to the end user)

## Use cases
- AR/VR, Connected Health, Smart Cities, Connected Cars
- Data should be processed in the edge

## Components
- Edge Devices → devices located at the edge of the network, close to the data source
- Data Processing → done locally on edge devices
- Data Storage → Edge devices can store data locally (reduce latency, security, privacy
- Connectivity → High Speed connectivity between edge devices and the rest of the network

## +/-
### Advantages
- Reduce Latency 
- Security 
- Privacy
- Scalability (Distributed and Decentralized Architecture)

### Disadvantages
- Complex
- Limited Resources
- Limited Coverage

## Fog vs Edge
-  Edge Computing does the computation and storage to the edge, Fog Computing extends cloud services and connectivity at the edge
